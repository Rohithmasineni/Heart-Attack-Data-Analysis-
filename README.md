## Heart Attack Analysis Among Young Adults (18-35) – SQL & Power BI

# 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze heart attack cases among young adults using SQL and Power BI to uncover key risk factors. By leveraging data analytics, we explored medical indicators, lifestyle habits, and their impact on cardiovascular health.

# 🔍 Key Insights
✔️ 50% of heart attack cases were linked to Hypertension Stage 2, highlighting the role of high blood pressure.
✔️ 584 cases involved high cholesterol, reinforcing its contribution to heart disease.
✔️ 418 heart attack cases were associated with diabetes, showcasing its critical role.
✔️ The average age of heart attack patients is just 26.48, emphasizing the growing risk among youngsters.
✔️ Urban lifestyle, screen time, and sleep quality emerged as significant health factors.

# 🛠 Tech Stack & Approach
✅ MySQL – Data extraction, database creation, and SQL queries for pattern analysis.
✅ Power BI – Interactive dashboards to visualize trends and key metrics.
✅ DAX – Custom measures and calculated columns for deeper insights.
📊 Dashboards & Visualizations

# The Power BI report includes:
📌 Key KPIs (Heart Attack Distribution, Average Blood Pressure, Cholesterol Levels)
📌 Heart Attack Cases by Risk Factors (Hypertension, Diabetes, Family History, Smoking, Alcohol Consumption)
📌 Comparative Analysis (Urban vs. Rural Trends, Sleep Patterns, and Screen Time Impact)

# 🚀 Why This Matters?
Heart attacks are no longer just a concern for older adults—data analysis reveals a rising trend among young individuals. By identifying high-risk factors, we can raise awareness and advocate for preventative healthcare measures.
